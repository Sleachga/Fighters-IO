# Fighters.io
##### I built this game on my other computer 
##### When my old computer broke I had a ton of issues with Github so I compressed the files, moved them over to my new computer, Made a new project on github and deleted the old one

##### Because of this I don't have the old commits but I commented most of my code so it should make sense.  Apologies for anyone looking for the old commits.

##### Trying to get this up on Heroku currently
